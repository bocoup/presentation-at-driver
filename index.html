Note:

When it comes to creating equitable experience for folks with disabilities, it
often feels like this work should have been done decades ago. Be that as it
may, it's happening now!

### Active automation efforts

**[Craig Morten's GuidePup](https://www.guidepup.dev/)** - subscribe to a
stream of speech being read by screen readers

**[W3C's WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/)** - query the
accessibility tree for fundamental values like ["computed
role"](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#get-computed-role)

**[W3C's AOM + WebDriver](https://github.com/WICG/aom/issues/203)** - query the
accessibility tree for even more properties such as
["required"](https://w3c.github.io/core-aam/#event-aria-required)

**[Igalia's Acacia](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/204)** -
query the [platform accessibility API mapping](https://w3c.github.io/core-aam/)

Note:

- GuidePup
  - available today
  - empowers developers to understand how their work is presented to screen
    reader users
  - limited to one type of AT: screen readers
  - not currently on a standards track
- WebDriver
  - available today
  - weakness: limited scope
- AOM + WebDriver
  - being designed as we speak
  - clear deployment path (extension to an existing standard)
- Acacia
  - enables automated testing of a novel surface: the accessibility API mapping
  - only accessible from [the Web Platform
    Tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt)

## AT Driver

> A standard protocol for introspection and remote control of assistive
> technology software, using a bidirectional communication channel.

https://github.com/w3c/at-driver

Note:

We have initially limited our focus to screen readers because you have to start
somewhere, but as the name implies, our scope includes all types of assistive
technology.

---

## AT Driver: in action

<video
  autoplay
  loop
  aria-label="A screen recording of a macOS system featuring a web browser operating a radio group alongside a Terminal window which streams structured data describing the key presses and spoken text"
  src="demo-macos.mp4"
  />

Note:

Here, we see the AT Driver protocol being used to automatically observe the
behavior of VoiceOver and Safari when rendering a radio group.

---

## AT Driver: vitals

- Chartered under [the W3C's Browser Testing and Tools Working
  Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/browser-tools-testing/)
- Inspiration from [WebDriver BiDi](https://github.com/w3c/webdriver-bidi/)
  (JSON over WebSockets, "remote end"/"local end" abstractions, "command" and
  "event" patterns)
- Distinction: these user agents are not web browsers. There is no "browsing
  session," no "DOM", no "elements," etc.

## Shoutout ARIA-AT

<iframe
  src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/651279608?h=45aefd646f&amp;byline=false&amp;dnt=true&amp;portrait=false"
  width="640" height="340" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="ARIA-AT Video">
</iframe>

https://aria-at.w3.org

Note:

The ARIA-AT Community Group is actively working to define expectations for the
behavior of assistive technology and to promote implementation correctness.
We've been developing AT Driver to support their work, but we anticipate the
protocol's eventual use by web authors.

---

## Future

- Define a collection of "intents" (first up: [activate element](https://github.com/w3c/at-driver/pull/82))
- Implement for Android's TalkBack and Apple's Mobile Safari
- Extend beyond screen readers
- Extend beyond the web platform?

Note:

- Other user intents might include things like "move to next heading" or "move
  to previous form field"
- Other assistive technologies might include braille displays or magnifiers
- This protocol could be used to write automated tests for native applications,
  though it's unclear if the use of WebSockets would be a significant
  impediment to adoption.
